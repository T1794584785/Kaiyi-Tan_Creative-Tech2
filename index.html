    <h3>At the very beginning, we tried to create a loop that a flower would bloom  triggered by something ( sound/light/vibration, etc.)</h3>
    <h2>Diagrams of Process</h2>

     <h3>Continuing in this vein, after a few successive iterations, we drew our earliest diagram, which clearly labeled the parts that the two ports were responsible for. Before the process starts, a noise trigger above a certain threshold is sent to port1, which then turns on the projector and shines the image on the photosensitive resistor, causing a change in its resistance, and sends a signal to the adafruit.io feeds when the resistance changes to a certain value. port2 starts the process when it receives a resistance value of the photosensitive resistor that is less than a certain threshold. The servo motor drives the paper flower to open while the noise generated by the servo motor is received by the sound sensor. The sound sensor transmits the noise in decibels to adafruit.io's feeds to be received by port1, which starts a new loop when the decibels exceed a certain threshold.</h3>

     <h3>In the October 13th class, realizing that it would be a bit complicated to use the projector, we replaced it with a strip of lights that could be driven by the esp32 that also glowed.</h3>
     <h3>I completed the port1 section and my partner completed the port2 section.</h3>
